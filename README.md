# Serverless To-Do App

This project is the final project of [Udacity's Cloud Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/cloud-developer-nanodegree--nd9990).

- The backend uses [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/), AWS [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and AWS [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), to process HTTP requests. The database used is AWS [DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/). Images uploaded by users are stored in AWS [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). The deployment of the application and the infrastructure is fully automated by a [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) script.

- The fronend uses [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), [SemanticUI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/), [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios), [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) and [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/).

- For authentication and authorization, the application uses [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) services.

- Both the frontend and backend use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), for end-to-end type safety.
